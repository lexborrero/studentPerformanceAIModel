# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction Using Random Forest (UCI Dataset)

This project demonstrates how to build a basic AI model in Python to predict student performance using data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** and serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning (ML) model development and evaluation.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Predict the performance level of students (e.g., low, medium, high) based on features like study time, family background, and school-related attributes.

**Dataset Source:**  
[UCI Student Performance Dataset (ID: 320)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)  
Loaded using the `ucimlrepo` Python package.
